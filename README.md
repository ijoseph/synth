## Problem 1: Parsing Sequence Strings

### Function a. `str` sequence -> `int` length of sequence in nucleotides

Basic idea: parse string into list of `Nucelotide` objects, detecting irregularities. Length is merely the length of the previously-parsed list. 


### Function b. `str` sequence -> `str` sequence type (âˆˆ {`chimera`, `mod RNA`, `vanilla RNA`})

Idea: using parsed-string, go through it to detect irregularities.
